      <h1>The Special Program</h1>
      <p>Hello World! is a traditionally the very first program taught when
	  new coders are attempting to learn a programming language for the first
	  time. It's very simple and effectively showcases the process of coding
	  and helps to ensure that the language and system is operating correctly. 
	  The program is really simple and easy to learn that anyone should be able
	  to do it, and if the program goes off without a hitch, then it's a sign of
	  goodluck and a fruitful journey!</p>
	  <p>Hello World also serves as a foundation for novice programmers so they can 
	  easily understand computer science principles. To put it in perspective, the 
	  object-oriented language C++ utilizes the "cout" statement to print text
	  string output to the console window, while another object-oriented language, 
	  Python uses the "print()" function to print string text to the console. Both 
	  languages have their own way of doing things, but you can learn a lot about how 
	  the language functions just by the syntax used to print "Hello World!" to the 
	  console window.</p>
	  <h2>The History of Hello World!</h2>
	  <p>Hello World was created by Brian Kernighan who is the author of one of the most 
	  widely read programming books, <i>C Programming Language.</i> However, he actually
	  first referenced Hello World in an entirely different book titled, <i>A Tutorial
	  Introduction to the Programming Language B.</i></p>
	  <p>It wasn't until during the 1970s when PDP-11, one of the first commmerical
	  microcomputers launched that Hello World began to spread. Many people before this
	  saw computers as complex and expensive, so they came across as intimidating. However,
	  people could now "talk" directly to their computers through programming, and beceause
	  of this, many people turned to Kernighan's <i>C Programming Language</i> and reintroduced
	  themselves to Hello World to start off their professional journey!</p>
	  <p>Now knowing some of the history of Hello World, you can see why we decided to name
	  our company "Hello World! Coding." We believe success starts here, and the first step
	  is the completion of the Hello World program. So much is gained from the successful
	  execution of your first program including: your first successful program execution, 
	  mastery of simple syntax, a working system, and your first step into the computer 
	  programming world!</p>
