      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>At Hello World! Coding, we believe that computer programming is something
		 that everyone has the potential to learn. On your own, learning to program
		 can be frustrating and difficult, so our staff try to improve this learning
		 experience by finding the best ways to make programming fun and exciting for
		 our students. The best teachers know the frustrations students are likely to 
		 face while learning how to code, and they also know the joy of creating new 
		 and exciting solutions to complex problems, or seeing one's development from 
		 a simple script printing "Hello World!" to creating a menu driven program that 
		 utilizes dynamic queues to take customer orders at a Coffee Cafe!</p>
		 <p>So be a part of our vision "To make coding fun for everyone!"</p>

      <h1>Comments</h1>
      <blockquote> Thank you for everything! I am amazed at 
         my progress. Before starting this program, I never thought I'd ever be able to code,
		 now I'm using conditional statements and arrays like no tomorrow!</blockquote>
      <blockquote> John kept me motivated even when I was struggling to grasp how class objects
		 worked. He creates a warm and fun environment for learning. I really enjoyed listening
		 to some of his struggles while he helped me through my own. Thank you!</blockquote>
      <blockquote> Wow...just wow! Your track record proves it.
         I'm so glad I came to you guys to teach me how to program! I was using etsy and eBay
		 for my online business, but now I'm able to create my own commerce site to sell my products!
		 I couldn't have done it without your continued support!</blockquote>
      <blockquote> The teachers at Hello World! Coding really treat you with respect. I never
		 felt judged by my lack of technological knowledge and they really helped me grasp how to 
		 even just use the computer. I know I'm being a bit ambitious wanting to learn how to code while 
		 barely knowing how to navigate my desktop, but I've always said, "Go hard or go home!" and the
		 teachers have been more than happy to help me reach my dreams!</blockquote>
